## TLDR Out-of-the-Box
### Getting started
&emsp;&emsp;Use these commands to clone and initialize TL-Test-New working directory:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/tl-test-new.git
cd tl-test-new # or move it to whatever working directory you want, does not matter
               # but make sure that no spaces in the absolute path
make init
```  
&emsp;&emsp;See the following chapters for the Out-of-the-Box usage of different integrated DUTs.

### For CoupledL2
#### 1. Build and Run

&emsp;&emsp;Currently integrated out-of-the-box test cases:  
* ```coupledL2-test-l2l3```
    * Pre-set configuration: **```configs/coupledL2-test-l2l3.tltest.ini```**  
* ```coupledL2-test-l2l3l2```   
    * Pre-set configuration: **```configs/coupledL2-test-l2l3l2.tltest.ini```**  

&emsp;&emsp;Verilating CoupledL2:  
```
make coupledL2-verilate
```  

> **Examples**  
> * Build CoupledL2 test case ```coupledl2-test-l2l3l2``` and run verilator host immediately after build:  
> ```
> make coupledL2-test-l2l3l2 run
> ```
> * Build CoupledL2 test case ```coupledl2-test-l2l3l2``` in 4 threads with Clang++ 17 in minimal (Verilator Host Mode only) and run verilator host immediately after build:    
> ```
> make coupledL2-test-l2l3l2-v3 run THREADS_BUILD=4 CXX_COMPILER=clang++-17
> ```

#### 2. Configuration
&emsp;&emsp;Refer to [Configuration](#configuration) for detailed configuration control.  
&emsp;&emsp;To change the pre-set configurations of CoupledL2 test cases, modify files **```configs/coupledL2-test-l2l3.tltest.ini```** and **```configs/coupledL2-test-l2l3l2.test.ini```**.   


### Build and Run
&emsp;&emsp;For building TL-Test-New seperately **(after verilated DUT)**:    
```
make tltest-build-all
```
&emsp;&emsp;For running after build:  
```
make run
```  
&emsp;&emsp;Build specified test case completely:  
```
make <test_case_name>
```  
&emsp;&emsp;Build specified test case for **DPI Guest Mode** only:  
```
make <test_case_name>-dpi
```
&emsp;&emsp;Build specified test case for **Verilator Host Mode** only:  
```
make <test_case_name>-v3
```

### Configuration  
&emsp;&emsp;Configuration files sit in **```configs```** directory.  
&emsp;&emsp;For detailed explanation of configuration file, see: Chapter [Post Build Configuration](#post-build-configuration).  
&emsp;&emsp;The user-defined custom configuration entries should be written into **```configs/user.tltest.ini```**.    
&emsp;&emsp;It's not recommended to add or change the section ```[tltest.config]``` (configuration entires related to core count and port organizations) in **```configs/user.tltest.ini```**.  


## Build
### 1. Build
#### 1.1 Before you build
&emsp;&emsp;Make sure that you are currently under the **main folder** of TL-Test-New ```cd main```.  
&emsp;&emsp;For first time build:
```bash 
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
```
> **NOTICE**: Building under other directories is also allowed, then change the cmake command on your demand
>

#### 1.2 Verilating
> This step could be **skipped** if you chose **NOT TO BUILD Verilator Host Mode** components by: 
> ```bash
> cmake .. -DBUILD_V3=0
> ```   
> For more information, see chatper [**Pre-Build Configuration**](#pre-build-configuration).
> 
&emsp;&emsp;Then you need to generate cpp files and library files using verilator.  
&emsp;&emsp;Requirements of verilating:
*  Use ```--cc``` parameter to generate C++ files  
*  Use ```--lib-create vltdut``` parameter to specify the output library to **```libvltdut.a```**   

&emsp;&emsp;Verilator build script for reference:  
```bash
verilator --trace --cc --build --lib-create vltdut --Mdir ./verilated ./coupledL2/build/*.v -Wno-fatal --top TestTop
```

#### 1.3 Building
```bash
make -j `nproc`
```  
> **NOTICE:** 
> Before you **make**:  
> * You need to set-up related project path and environment variables correctly, see chapter [**Pre-Build Configuration**](#pre-build-configuration)  
> * You need to set-up verilator include path correctly for **Verilator Host Mode**, see chapter [**Pre-Build Configuration**](#pre-build-configuration)  
> * You need to **set-up PortGen** correctly for **Verilator Host Mode**, see chapter [**Pre-Build Configuration**](#pre-build-configuration)  
> 
&emsp;&emsp;The default working tree without user configuration is:

```

## Pre-build Configuration
### 1. Paths and executables  
#### 1.1 ```CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER```  
&emsp;&emsp;Specify the **user-defined C++ compiler** for build-time and run-time procedures on demand.  
* Configuring: 
    * ```cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<compiler>```   
* Passing to compiler:
    * ```-DCXX_COMPILER="${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER}"``` as global macro ```CXX_COMPILER```

&emsp;&emsp;Specify the **user-defined current source directory** on demand.  
* Configuring:
    * ```cmake .. -DCMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR=<dir>```  
* Passing to compiler:  
    * ```-DCURRENT_PATH="${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}"``` as global macro ```CURRENT_PATH```  

#### 1.3 ```VERILATED_PATH```  
&emsp;&emsp;Specify the **verilator output path** of DUT.  
* Configuring:  
    * ```cmake .. -DVERILATED_PATH=<dir>```  
* Passing to compiler:  
    * ```-DVERILATED_PATH="${VERILATED_PATH}"``` as global macro ```VERILATED_PATH```  
    * ```-DVERILATED_PATH_TOKEN=${VERILATED_PATH}``` as global macro ```VERILATED_PATH_TOKEN```  

#### 1.4 ```VERILATOR_INCLUDE```  
&emsp;&emsp;Specify the **verilator include path**.
* Configuring:  
    * ```cmake .. -DVERILATOR_INCLUDE=<dir>```  
* Passing to compiler:  
    * ```-DVERILATOR_INCLUDE="${VERILATOR_INCLUDE}"``` as global macro ```VERILATOR_INCLUDE```  

#### 1.5 ```DUT_PATH```
&emsp;&emsp;Specify the **source directory of DUT**.  
* Configuring:  
    * ```cmake .. -DDUT_PATH=<dir>```  
* Passing to compiler:
    * ```-DDUT_PATH="${DUT_PATH}"``` as global macro ```DUT_PATH```  
    * ```-DDUT_PATH_TOKEN=${DUT_PATH}``` as global macro ```DUT_PATH_TOKEN```  

#### 1.6 ```DUT_BUILD_PATH```  
&emsp;&emsp;Specify the **build directory of DUT**.  
* Configuring:  
    * ```cmake .. -DDUT_BUILD_PATH=<dir>```  
* By default:
    * ```DUT_BUILD_PATH=${DUT_PATH}/build```  
* Passing to compiler:  
    * ```-DDUT_BUILD_PATH="${DUT_BUILD_PATH}"``` as global macro ```DUT_BUILD_PATH```

    * ```-DCHISELDB_PATH_TOKEN=${CHISELDB_PATH}``` as global macro ```CHISELDB_PATH_TOKEN``` 

### 2. PortGen  

#### 2.1 Dynamic PortGen (Experimental)
<img src="assets/README.portgen.dynamic.png" height=200 alt="TL-Test-New overall" align=right />

&emsp;&emsp;Choose to generate PortGen connection library on run-time (experimental function).  
* Configuring:
    * ```cmake .. -DTLTEST_PORTGEN_DYNAMIC=1```  

&emsp;&emsp;Dynamic PortGen mode is available only when the TL-Test Subsystem is delivered with all source code (including the verilator output of DUT), and is **disabled by default**.    
&emsp;&emsp;Dynamic PortGen enables you to change the TileLink port configuration at run-time through ```tltest.ini``` for **Verilator Host Mode**, without any extra coding.  
&emsp;&emsp;Dynamic PortGen requires accessible ```/tmp``` directory and working C++ compilers (support at least C++17) on verilator running environment.  
&emsp;  
&emsp;&emsp;***NOTICE**: When using Dynamic PortGen, the source code directory and verilator output directory on build must not be moved or removed.   

#### 2.2 Static PortGen
<img src="assets/README.portgen.static.png" height=200 alt="TL-Test-New overall" align=right />

&emsp;&emsp;Choose to generate PortGen connection library on build-time.
* Configuring:
    * ```cmake .. [-DTLTEST_PORTGEN_DYNAMIC=0]```  

&emsp;&emsp;Static PortGen enables you to change the TileLink port configuration at build-time through ```tltest.ini``` or ```portgen``` executable with parameters for **Verilator Host Mode**, without any extra coding.    
&emsp;&emsp;```VERILATED_PATH``` and ```VERILATOR_INCLUDE``` parameters above are required to be configured correctly.   

&emsp;&emsp;**By default**, the PortGen is under **static mode** as ```TLTEST_PORTGEN_DYNAMIC=0``` without specifying the parameter.

### 3. Build selection 
#### 3.1 ```BUILD_DPI```
&emsp;&emsp;Build components of **DPI Guest Mode** or not.  
* Configuring: 
    * ```cmake .. -DBUILD_DPI=<ON/OFF>```   

&emsp;&emsp;By default, ```BUILD_DPI=ON```.  
&emsp;&emsp;When this was turned off, components and outputs of **DPI Guest Mode** would not be built.

#### 3.2 ```BUILD_V3```
&emsp;&emsp;Build components for **Verilator Host Mode** or not.  
* Configuring: 
    * ```cmake .. -DBUILD_V3=<ON/OFF>```  

&emsp;&emsp;By default, ```BUILD_V3=ON```.  
&emsp;&emsp;When this was turned off, components and outputs of **Verilator Host Mode** would not be built.  

## Run as **Verilator Host**
&emsp;&emsp;Run executable **```tltest_v3lt```** to start the verilator test.   
&emsp;&emsp;In build directory: 
```bash
./tltest_v3lt
```  
&emsp;&emsp;You could copy the binary **```tltest_v3lt```** with **```tltest_portgen.so```** (when compiled with **Static PortGen**) together to other directories or delivery to execute on demand.  
&emsp;&emsp;When compiled with **Dynamic PortGen**, the binaries must be delivered with source code of TL-Test-New and verilator output.  

## Load as **DPI Guest**
&emsp;&emsp;Load DPI-C library **```libtltest_dpi.so```** on simulation run.  
> **EXAMPLE** (on VCS):  
> * Add parameter ```-sv_liblist bootstrap_lib_files``` on VCS run.  
> * Create a file naming **```bootstrap_lib_files```**, and edit it with the following contents:  
> ```
> #!SV_LIBRARIES
> tl-test/main/build/libtltest_dpi
> ```  
>

## Post-build Configuration
&emsp;&emsp;On the start-up procedure of TL-Test-New, the file **```tltest.ini```** in the working directory would be read if exists to override the pre-build defined configurations.  
&emsp;&emsp;The example and template of **```tltest.ini```** is as follwing:  
```ini
[tltest.config]
core                        = 4
core.tl_c                   = 1
core.tl_ul                  = 2

[tltest.fuzzer]
seed                        = 1001
ari.interval                = 1000000
ari.target                  = 1

[tltest.logger]
verbose                     = 1
verbose.xact_fired          = 1
verbose.xact_sequenced      = 0
verbose.xact_data_complete  = 1
verbose.data_full           = 0
verbose.agent_debug         = 0
```  
&emsp;&emsp;***NOTICE**: Not all key-values above were required to be present, and the absent configuration key-values would be set as it was on build.  

### 1. Essential configurations (```tltest.config```)  
#### 1.1 ```core```  
&emsp;&emsp;Specify the **core count** of DUT.  

#### 1.2 ```core.tl_c```
&emsp;&emsp;Specify the **TileLink-C port count per core** of DUT.  
&emsp;&emsp;The acceptable value is ``1``.  

#### 1.3 ```core.tl_ul```  
&emsp;&emsp;Specify the **TileLink-UL port count per core** of DUT.  
&emsp;&emsp;The acceptable values are ``0`` and ``2``.  

### 2. Fuzzer & ARI configurations (```tltest.fuzzer```)  
#### 2.1 ```seed```  
&emsp;&emsp;Specify the **randomization seed** of this run.  

#### 2.2 ```ari.interval```  
&emsp;&emsp;Specify the **simulation time of each iteration element of ARI** of this run.

#### 2.3 ```ari.target```  
&emsp;&emsp;Specify the **total count of iteration cycle of ARI** of this run.  
&emsp;&emsp;The total simulation time to finish is calculated by: ```total_time = ARI::element_count * ari.interval * ari.target```.  
&emsp;&emsp;***NOTICE:** The ```ARI::element_count``` is specified on build currently.  

### 3. Verbose logging configurations (```tltest.logger```)  
#### 3.1 ```verbose```  
&emsp;&emsp;Specify the enablement of **verbose information mode**.  

#### 3.2 ```verbose.xact_fired```  
&emsp;&emsp;Specify the enablement of verbose information on every message fired.  

#### 3.3 ```verbose.xact_sequenced```  
&emsp;&emsp;Specify the enablement of verbose information on every message sequenced by the sequencer and the fuzzer.  

#### 3.4 ```verbose.xact_data_complete```  
&emsp;&emsp;Specify the enablement of verbose information on every transaction carrying data is completed (useful for multi-beat data transactions).  

#### 3.5 ```verbose.data_full```  
&emsp;&emsp;Specify the enablement of verbose information of full data bytes on every transaction carrying data.  
&emsp;&emsp;Recommended to disable by default for a normally relatively more readable log.  

#### 3.6 ```verbose.agent_debug```  
&emsp;&emsp;Specify the enablement of verbose information of agent debug.  
&emsp;&emsp;Recommended to disable by default, mostly used for TileLink Agent tweaking.
